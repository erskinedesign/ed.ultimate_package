# The Ultimate Package &trade;

The Ultimate Package is [Good Work][1]'s framework for rapidly developing the front-end of our projects and is under constant development and improvement by the team at Good Work, who use it daily.

## Requirements

- [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) `gem install bundler` if you don't have it

## Getting started

If you're just getting setup, run:

1. `bundle install`

Else, follow these difficult steps:

1. `compass watch`

## Development

Use [gitflow][2] (Always work from `develop` and use release branches to merge into `master`, etc.)
